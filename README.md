## Example

To use Halo, you will need to create a file with the `.halo` extension and write your code in the form of natural language. For example:
```
echo "Do a google web search for the first command line argument. display the url, title and first paragraph of content for the top 3 results" > search.halo
```
Once you have written your code, you can run it using the `halo` command:
```
halo search.halo "Halo lang‚Äù
```
which prints
